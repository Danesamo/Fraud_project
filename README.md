## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Contents

- `FraudFinal.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the final implementation and analysis.
- `model.h5`: Trained model file.
- `model1.h5`: Another trained model file.
- `models_classif_smote.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with models using SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:
